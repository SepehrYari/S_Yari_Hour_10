Is the Game too Easy or Hard?

So fundamentally the game is really easy. If you really wanted you could hold your hands off the keyboard and just wait for the balls to land in the goals themselves because of how fast everything is moving, there is nothing to stop the ball from sliding into their own goal, however that being said once the player involves themselves then does the game change where with your own actions it could make it impossible to reach the ball if you hit it so many times where it just picked up tons and tons of speed. So whether it is hard or easy is entirely dependent on the player.

What would make it easier or harder?

To give it its fair challenge so that the player has to get involved in a way that would require precision it would be fair to add barriers around the goals that the player has to break. But to make it farther from easy add more chaos balls so that it is difficult to hit the barriers dead on

What would give it a “WOW” factor?

The real WOW factor that I had in mind would be some sort of scenery change where instead of at the beach over water the game takes place as an Air Hockey game and just for kicks add in a few aliens observing the game.

What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?

The fun parts of the game is watching the balls bounce around like crazy, it has a fun visual for a simple game. The parts of the game that I thought felt tedious was definitely trying to actually hit the ball, the thin rectangle moving around feels clunky to hit the goal balls around.
